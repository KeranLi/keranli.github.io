Currently, I'm a PhD student from [School of Earth Sciences and Engineering](https://es.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Xiumian Hu and Dr. Anlin Ma. Before that, I received the M.Sc degree of Petroleum Geology in 2023 and B. Eng degree of Petroleum Geology in 2020 at Chengdu University of Technology, supervised by Prof. Jinmin Song.

My research interest includes Sedimentary applications busing computer vision, machine learning, deep learning. Also, I do some researches about geochemical sedimentolgy in carbonate via major/trace elements, carbonate U-Pb dating, C-O-Sr-Ca-Mg-Triple oxygen isotopes and corresponding modeling. Before geochemical analysis, I take careful analysis in field investigation, microscopic thin-section observation, CL and SEM analysis.

Now I'm training large-, pretrained, and foundational backbones for sedimentology. Also, I'm using mutiple isotopic proxies to explore the Tibet plateau.
