The paper presents a novel approach for well-log lithological interpretation by incorporating spatial-stratigraphic information and a dynamic range attention (DRA) mechanism. The authors introduce two main innovations: the Spatial and Stratigraphic Information Processing (SSP) method, which encodes geological sequences as time series to capture the spatial and stratigraphic context, and the DRA mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the local attention scope based on the global context, enhancing the model’s efficiency and accuracy. The DRA-BiLSTM model, integrated with SSP, demonstrated excellent performance on a dataset from the eastern Sichuan Basin, achieving high accuracies (0.99 for training, 0.97 for validation, and 0.92 for testing), significantly improving the interpretation of complex lithologies and addressing challenges such as overfitting. The study suggests that combining domain-specific data processing with lightweight attention mechanisms offers a promising path for automated geophysical applications.
