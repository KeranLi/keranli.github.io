This study employs spectral graph convolution networks (GCNs) to predict microbialite lithology in the Dengying Formation's Moxi gas field. By integrating time-series and spectral data from conventional well logs, the GCN model outperforms other machine learning methods, achieving high accuracy (0.90) and F1-score (0.90). The results highlight the potential of GCNs in enhancing lithological classification and aiding petroleum exploration
