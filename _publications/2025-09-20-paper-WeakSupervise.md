TThe paper introduces a novel method for semantic segmentation of carbonate thin-section images using weakly supervised learning techniques. The proposed CamNet model integrates Class Activation Mapping (CAM), Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and Knowledge Distillation (KD) to optimize segmentation performance while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for deployment on edge devices. The system achieves high segmentation accuracy and inference speed (6.87 fps) with just 800k parameters, making it feasible for real-time use in resource-constrained environments like fieldwork and microscopic analysis. The integration of traditional computer vision techniques and advanced deep learning methods provides a robust solution for geological image segmentation with practical applications in both academic and industrial settings.
